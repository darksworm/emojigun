We should be able to search for a hotkey in a specific application by
tags, text and keys themselves.

See [sample.yaml](../static/sample.yaml) for how a hotkey list might
look

1.  Config files should have separate indexes.
2.  We should index tags and descriptions (split into words).
3.  We should index the associated keys.

**But is indexing really necessary?**

Iâ€™m omitting indexing for now. Will return to this if the necessity
shows.
