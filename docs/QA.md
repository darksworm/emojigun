1.  Wouldnâ€™t pressing hotkeys cause them to execute? Is there a way
    around this? We can grab the keyboard input in Xlib using
    *XGrabKeyboard* more info
    [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/input/XGrabKeyboard.html](here)
2.  I want the tool to be as light as possible so i am grativating
    towards C, but I want to avoid as much frustration as possible since
    this is a hobby project. What are the alternatives? Looks like im
    stuck with C.
