1. Wouldn't pressing hotkeys cause them to execute? Is there a way around this?
   We can grab the keyboard input in Xlib using *XGrabKeyboard* more info [https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/input/XGrabKeyboard.html](here)
   Consuming keyboard events should probably be a toggleable option as hooking into the input requires root privileges.
2. I want the tool to be as light as possible so i am grativating towards C, but I want to avoid as much frustration as possible since this is a hobby project. What are the alternatives?
   Looks like im stuck with C.
