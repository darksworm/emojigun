### The problem

Every chat service has their own different emojis and getting custom emojis on the service is not always possible (skype) or is behind a paywall (discord).

### The solution

A tool that can be used to quickly select a stored image and copy it to your clipboard.

### The workflow

1. Open emojigun (preferably, bind it to a hotkey)
2. Search for image by name, by typing it
3. Select the image with arrow keys
4. Press return to copy the image to your clipboard
